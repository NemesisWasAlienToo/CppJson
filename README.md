# CppJson

This implementation of Json at least at this point is __ONLY__ for educational purposes.
The goal of this implementation is to implement json in c++ the simplest possible way and to demonstrate a few fundamental problems which will arise in the process.

to compile the example just do

```sh
g++ Sample/Json.cpp -o Build/Json.elf -std=c++2a -Wall -Wpedantic -ILibrary
```
